**Abstract:** 

In this project I integrated into a research team that explored a novel concept in unconventional robotics - a robot made of non-Newtonian fluid (NNF). These fluids are defined by a nonlinear relation between viscosity and strain rate. Here the robot was driven by sound waves (by placing it on a speakers surface). 

My aim was to quantify the robot behavior by video analyzing of experiments in which it performs several tasks.

Below is a captured image from a video where robot moves from point A to B (speakeres are represented by circles). Cross marks an approximate midpoint <br><br>
