# A-non-Newtonian-Fluid-Robot
Project in object detection and tracking in video (as part of my B.Sc. studies, 2015)


**Abstract** 

In this project I integrated into a research team that explored a novel concept in unconventional robotics - a robot made of non-Newtonian fluid (NNF). These fluids, defined by a nonlinear relation between viscosity and strain rate, provide an interesting framework for producing animal-like behaviors as well as non-animal features such as splitting and plasticity. 
My task was to quantify the robot behavior by video analyzing of experiments in which it performs several tasks.
